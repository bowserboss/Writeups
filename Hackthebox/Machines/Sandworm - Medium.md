There is a domain linked to the site `http://ssa.htb` Port `80` redirects to `443` looking around the site there is a contact page that takes pgp signed messages and a another page for us to encrypt messages and the page says its powered by `flask` so we can try SSTI but we need to use gpg to sign messages on are host `gpg --gen-key` to make a new key now to we need to download the public key now we need to import it `gpg --import ssa.pub` and take a note of the email they use `atlas@ssa.htb` now we need to make a message and sign it `gpg --encrypt --armor -r atlas@ssa.htb ssti.msg` we can decrypt it on the site and we dont get anything back one thing we can try is ssti in the name field of a new key and then use the site to verify the signature now we need to make a new key with the same steps and put the ssti payload in the name section and verify it on the site and we get a call back as `atlas` on the machine trying to do enumeration on the host and found out were in a fire jail looking at the web folder there is mysql creds in `__init__.py` `atlas:GarlicAndOnionZ42` looking in the home folder there is a `.config` and if we keep going into all the folders we find a `amdin.json` which has some creds to it `silentobserver:quietLiketheWind22` and these creds work for ssh running `pspy` we can see there is a program being ran called `tipnet` and its using a vulnerable package `logger` and there is a firejail exploit `cve-2022-31214` we can use this to get to root user but first we need to get to the user atlas we can edit the `lib.rs` file and since it compiles every time before running we can put some code in there to get a reverse shell thats not in the firejail and then we can run the poc script agin and get to root user
