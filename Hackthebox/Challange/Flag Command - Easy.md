Started with trying to play the game but all the options lead to the same answer so going to look at the source and found 3 javascript files `commands,js,main.js and game.js` looking into the `main.js` file there is a option called secret so I entered the word secret and nothing happened so looking into the network calls now I see a GET request to a `/api/options` and its has all the answers to the challenge including the secret so I entered the answer to the secret in and got to the flag `Blip-blop, in a pickle with a hiccup! Shmiggity-shmack`
