Started with a nmap scan comes back with a bunch of ports from the range of `9000-13999` they all say they have ssh running so when connecting to port 9000 you will get a message of higher or lower but the hint from the room says were looking threw a mirror  so higher really means lower and lower means higher when connecting to the port we will get a message of lower so then we can just start jumping around in ports until we find the right one after a little bit the right port will have a challenge message we need to decode  if you google auto detect cipher and we get a `Vigenere` cipher and then looking at the message we see some words have more than 10 letters so if you set the max key size to `20` and we get it to decode the whole message will give us the key then take that key and decode it again for the secret for the message `bewarethejabberwock` this key will change every time after the box restarts and then you will get the login for ssh which is on the default port and we have access to the server and the user flag to decode the user flag just reverse the text to get root I used PwnKit
