Going to the site we get rick rolled so I culled the site and it does have a note and it gives us a domain for the git `git.git-and-crumpets.thm` going to the domain we get a gitea running and its version `1.14.0` looking in the repos in the scones repo we looking at all the commits and there is one called password files and it says `the password in  my avatar` so we need to get the avatar and running exiftool on the image we got the password for `scones` but we also need his email `withcream@example.com` `Pa......` now that we are logged in we need to see if we can push git commits and we can so if we go to the git hooks we can go to update and put a bash rev shell in it and then push a commit and we get a call back as the git user we can send linpeas with scp onto the host we see there is a gitea in the `/var/lib` and in the data folder there is a database it has some hashes but they did not crack and so I went back and was looking around and noticed there is a repo set to private when we update it with this command `UPDATE repository SET is_private=0 WHERE name='backup'` now we can see the backup repo now we go back to the site and we can see a new repo called backup and a new user `groot` the backup looks empty but there is a file called dotfiles and there is a ssh key in the commits and then we have to crack the password for the id_rsa hash after letting it john run for a while it never cracked so i looked back at the repo and tried the name of the file `..........` was the password and now we are root
