The site redirects us to a domain called `airplane.thm` 
Started a gobuster scan 
```
/index.html
/airplane
```
When we go to the site I noticed that it goes to a `/?pahe=index.html` so I tested for LFI and got it was able to see `passwd` so looking around at files we can see the webserver is running as `hudson` so lets try and guess what's he can see in his home folder I took a guess that the folder was called `app` and normally the python file normally called `main or app.py` so now we check the process to see what's running and we can fuzz the pid numbers and we can see its running a gdbserver and this can be exploited there is a couple methods on hacktricks and now we have a reverse shell as the user `hudson` running linpeas we can use there is a suid as carlos for the command find and if we look at GTFObins we there a suid for find and running it now we are carlos next we need to add a ssh-rsa key to the authorized keys file now we can run sudo -l and we can see we can run ruby in the root folder so we can make a script to make us root
```
system("/bin/bash")
```
and now run it and we are root
