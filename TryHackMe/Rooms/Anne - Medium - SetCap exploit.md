Started with a nmap scan 
```
22 openssh 7.6p1 Ubuntu
7070 anydesk
35325 closed unknown
38787 closed unknown
50001 anydesk
```

So we did not get much from the nmap scan the only thing interesting is port `7070` and from looking into anydesk port `50001` should also be open we cant tell what version it is but from a  quick google search we find a RCE for version `5.5.2` see how thing is the only thing we can go off of I tried the exploit you need to put your own shell code into the exploit and run it on port `50001` and now we got a shell as `annie` under there home folder found a `.ssh` folder with a `id_rsa` key in it need a password for the key so I cracked it with john `annie:ann.....` now we got real shell access to the host im going to put linpeas on the host and see what we can find we found that we can exploit the `setcap` and were going to use python3 to get root with these commands 
```
cp /usr/bin/python3
setcap cap_setuid+ep /home/annie/python3
./python3 -c 'import os; os.setuid(0); os.system("/bin/bash")'
```
and now were are root
