Started with ssh bruteforce on user `noraj` got the password after like a hour `chesseburger` so by doing `echo $SHELL` we are in a rzsh shell and its restricting a lot to read files we can do `echo $(<user.txt)` and to show all hidden files we can do `echo ./.*` and there is a `.hint.txt` file also in the bin folder there is a `test.rb` file and we can use this to exec commands to get a reverse shell and then in that rev shell we need to set are paths to zsh and then we can use netcat to scan for ports on the local host and found port `31547` is open so now were going to be in side to netcat sessions and we are still getting some bad characters but we can use this payload to read the root flag `%x{cat /root/*}`
