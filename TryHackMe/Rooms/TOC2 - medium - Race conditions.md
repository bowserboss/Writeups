When we go to the site its a under construction page but nmap showed us that there is a `robots.txt` file there is one disallowed entry for a install file for the cms and a note saying to `finish setting up the cms and the database cmsmsdb` when installing it we find the php version and the OS running on the host and we can find the version of the cms on robots page that's on the webhost there is a RCE exploit `CVE-2018-7448` we can inject code into the time zone and it will be in the `config.php` file but we need to make the database name of database `cmsmsdb` user `cmsmsuser` password `devpass` after we do all the installing of the site we can then go to `/config.php?cmd=id` and we get `www-data` now we need to make a sh file with are rev shell then stand up a webserver and download it and run it and now we are `www-data` going to `frank` home folder we can read the flag and also there is a txt file called `new_machine` which says the password for frank and we can su into frank and then make a `.ssh` folder and a `authorized_keys` file and add are keys now we can get a real shell and looking at the hint we need to do a logrotate exploit were going to need two windows for this in one we run `./rename payload root_password_backup` and in the other window run `./readcreds root_password_backup` may have to run the last command a couple times but it will give the root password and now we have the root flag
