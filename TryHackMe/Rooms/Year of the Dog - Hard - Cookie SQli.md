Looking at the site we get put into a q and it sets a cookie when sending this request to burp  and add a `'` to the cookie gives us a sql error so doing so sql injection we got the version of that database so then I used this payload to get the table name 
`' union slect 1, table_name FROM information_schema.tables-- -` 
and got the name now `queue` but there was nothing else so then I tried something that don't normally work since its a very bad misconfiguration is allowing files to be added via sql injection but it worked and I got a `shell.php` and we have RCE on the host now I was just doing some basic looking around the file host before I tried to get a reverse shell and I found a file in the home folder of `dylan` called `work_analysis` and it has the password for the user `dylan` hidden in the logs so now we got a real shell on the host the password is `.............` running lipeas on the host shows us there is a port `3000` running in a docker gittea instance so we port forward and we can now connect to the git but we have no way to login in also in the linpeas showed we have access to a gittea folder we can read and write to that has a database in it `/gitea/gitea/gitea.db` file we can get the database on are host edit it and then put it on the host but first we need to make a account so we can give it admin rights we have to use scp to transfer the file or something happens and the site with just 500 error now that we are admin we can make a repo and then go to settings and put a bash reverse shell in the git hooks and edit the `pre-receive` and then we push a file to the repo as the user `dylan` and now we are the git user to get to root we can just `sudo su root` and we are now root and if we go to the `/data` folder were mirroring the `/gitea` folder on the host machine if we host a webserver on dylan and copy bash over to the root on the docker and give it permissions and then go to the `/gitea` folder as dylan we can `./bash -p` and now we are root
